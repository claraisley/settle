  const intro = "Anxiety is a normal human emotion that causes increased alertness, fear, and physical signs, such as a rapid heart rate. Almost everyone experiences some nervousness or anxiety before, during, or even after an exam. It is perfectly natural to be anxious before a test and believe it or not, this stress can actually be a good thing since some stress is required for you to perform optimally! In some cases however, a student may experience frequent and intense fears or worries before a test or exam, causing them to feel too much anxiety. Too much anxiety means your body’s 'fight or flight' response is over-stimulated and at that point all the extra adrenaline being released actually becomes distracting and your performance declines. This extra anxiety, commonly referred to as Test Anxiety, makes it difficult for a student to demonstrate what they know during a test or exam. This is because Test Anxiety creates a kind of 'noise' or 'mental static' in the brain, blocking our ability to grab facts and knowledge stored in our memory, while also messing with our ability to understand questions and solve them. Because it’s natural for students to base some of their self-worth on their academic performance, it makes sense that test anxiety can lead to a host of problems in those who suffer with it. Finally, it’s important to note that each person who deals with test anxiety will experience a different collection of symptoms with differing degrees of intensity."
